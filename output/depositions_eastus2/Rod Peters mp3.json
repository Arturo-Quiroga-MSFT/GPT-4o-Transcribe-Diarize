      "text": "This is the due diligence test for Monday, December 13th, 2021.\nMike Forre. This concludes the due diligence test for Monday, December 13, 2021.\nMeasure it in you do swear that the testimony not to give shall be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God I will. I do. Good morning, Mr. Peters. Good morning. You understand we're here in Hayward, Wisconsin to take your deposition to show to the jury at our trial in Milwaukee, correct? Correct. And because of prior commitments, you and your wife Teresa can't come to trial in person, and so you've agreed to give your videotapes video testimony so the jury can hear from you. Is that true? Correct.\nUm, you've been deposed in this case previously, correct? That's correct. And the difference between that deposition, Mr. Peters, and this deposition is that that was a, what we would call a discovery deposition, and this is one we're going to play as a trial deposition, okay? I don't want to go through all the rules of depositions again. I think you...\nI've read your deposition. I think you understood the process. But just so you understand, you're under oath today just like you would be if you were testifying in front of a judge and jury, correct? I understand, yes. Okay. If you don't understand one of my questions at any time, Mr. Peters, please just let me know and I'll rephrase it, okay? Okay. In front of you is a screen, and with that screen I will bring up some documents for us to look at together. If you want to see a hard copy of a document, you're welcome to do it.\nBut the screen kind of just speeds things up, so just let me know. Okay. If at any time Mr. Steff is here who represents flavour development, if he makes an objection, that's for the record. And just wait for him to finish his objection and then you can go ahead and answer the question afterwards, okay. Okay. Okay.\nMr. Peters, you understand that I represent Nick Mansell in a lawsuit against a company called Flavor Development, right? I do. And if I refer to Nick Mansell as Nick, can we agree that you'll know who I'm talking about? Yes, sir. You and your wife co-own a business called Midwest Roasters here in Hayward, is that true? That's true. And just so the jury understands, and they've already heard a lot about Midwest Roasters by the time your testimony will be heard.\nYou're in the business of roasting, flavoring, and grinding bulk coffee for sale, true? That's correct. And you sell in grocery stores and to individual customers all over Wisconsin, is that right? Yes, we do. And that is all done out of your building in Hayward, Wisconsin, where we are today, true? Correct. And I should say where we are today, not in the building, but in Hayward. That's correct. Okay. When did you first start roasting and flavoring coffee at Midwest Roasters, Mr. Peters?\nWell, I started when we were actually in town September 16, 1997. That's the date you remember. Yes, I do. Okay. And you're still in operation today, which is December 13th of 2021, correct? That's correct. Okay. I want to shift gears, Mr. Peters, and talk to you about Nick Mansell, okay? Okay.\nHe worked at Midwest Roasters from 2008 until 2015, is that right? I believe that's correct. And in fact, in documents Midwest Roasters produced in this case, he started on August 26, 2008 and he resigned on September 29, 2015. Does that sound true? It sounds correct. I don't remember the dates. My wife has those. Okay.\nDuring his entire employment from 2008 until 2015, Nick's primary job was roasting, flavoring, and grinding and packaging coffee, true? That's correct. Meaning that Nick would be one of the people who added flavors to the roasted coffee beans and mixed them together to coat the beans, correct? That's correct. I want to focus your attention or focus the attention of this testimony, Mr. Peters, on flavoring that was used by Nick Moncel the whole time he worked at Midwest Roasters, okay? Okay.\nFrom August of 2008 until September of 2015, the only company that sold artificial flavors to Midwest Roasters was the defendant in our lawsuit, Flavor Development. Is that true? True.",

Is that right? Objective Foreman Foundation. Go ahead. Uh, yes. As far as I know, that was it. Okay. I want to specifically talk to you about a chemical called diacetyl, okay? Okay.\nI'll represent to you that when flavor development bought chemicals or bought diacetyl during the time they sold you flavoring the only company they bought those from is a company called O'Laughlin okay prior Okay. to this lawsuit had you ever heard of O'Laughlin chemicals sir okay\nAnd I'll represent to you that Alofom was the only supplier of diacetyl to flavor development during that 2008 to 2012 time period, okay? Okay. That's what the evidence in this case is going to be. So let's talk about diacetyl, Mr. Peters. Very important to the jury is this issue. The first time you ever recall hearing the word diacetyl was related to Nick Monsell's lawsuit in 2017. Is that true? That's Check to correct. the form. Let me ask it again.\nThis is an important question that's one I want to focus your attention on, Mr Peters. The first time you ever recall hearing the word diacetyl was related to Nick Moncel's lawsuit in 2017, is that correct? That's correct. In fact, you're not aware of any documents or warnings from Flavour Development that contain the word diacetyl prior to 2017, is that right? That's correct. Now as the owner of Midwest Roasters, Mr Peters,\nIt's fair to say that you would expect companies who sell you products to use in your coffee business to be honest with you about the safety of the products you buy, correct? Correct. And that's something you rely on for the safety of yourself and your employees, true? True. Because if there are dangers associated with chemicals or flavors that you and your employees are using, you'd like to know about that so you can protect them, right? Correct. And you're not going to ignore safety warnings at your business, true?\nLet's look at the warnings that O'Loughlin gave to flavor development regarding diacetyl back when Nick worked for you, okay? And to do that, I want to show you several documents on the screen in front of you. Now, are you familiar with the general term material data safety sheet, correct? Correct. This is a document that chemical manufacturers send to customers to warn or inform them about the chemicals they're sending, right? Yes. As part of your job as owner of Midwest Roasters, you've seen those before, true? True.\nIn fact, it's your testimony, Mr. Peters, that flavor development at from time to time would send their own documents with shipments that they provided to you, correct? Correct. But because you never you've never heard of diacetyl before this lawsuit, is it fair to say that flavor development never warned about the diacetyl prior to 2017? I would say true. Okay. Let's start with exhibit nine, Mr. Peters, and this will come up on the screen here in front of you.\nI'll make this bigger for you. I can see. Hello. Do it again. I'm going to bring up exhibit nine in front of you, sir. And I'm going to make this a little bit bigger for you here. This is a material data safety sheet from a Laughlin Industries. Do you see that at the top? Yes, sir. Now you've never seen this document before today. Is that fair? I would say that is true. Okay. You can see that this is a\nmaterial data safety sheet for diacetyl correct and Correct. it was created in September of 2001 but revised in December of 2007 true I want to show you page four of this document and what O'Loughlin is telling anyone who buys diacetyl from them mr. Peters is\nFor respirators, follow the OSHA respirator regulations found in this code and always use a NIOSH or European standard approved respirator when necessary. Do you see that? Yes, I do. This document would have been created in December of 2007, so that's about eight months before Nick Montel came to work for you, correct? Correct.\nMr. Peters, at no time in 2007, 2008, or 2009 did flavor development ever tell Midwest Roasters that your employees should be wearing a NIOSH-approved respirator when using diacetyl, did they?",

      "text": "I do not remember seeing that. Because if they did, Mr. Peters, you would have made sure that your people like Nick would have worn them, right? Correct. I mean if someone comes to flavor to or someone comes to Midwest Roasters and says, Mr. Peters, this chemical in these flavorings is recommended that you wear a respirator approved by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. Safety and Health, that's not something that you would have ignored as the owner of Midwest Roasters, right? Correct.\nAnd so in 2007, 2008, and 2009, because you were not warned by flavor development, no one wore NIOSH respirators when handling flavors with diacetyl, did they? Correct. All right, let's look at page five of exhibit nine, sir. This is the same 2007 diacetyl material data safety sheet that flavor development would have had as early as December of 2007.\nAnd here it says inhalation, toxic if inhaled. Do you see where I've read that? Yes, sir. Flavour development never told Midwest Roasters in 2007, 8 or 9 that diacetyl was toxic if inhaled, did they? I do not recall that. Because again, you follow safety warnings for your employees, correct? Correct. And if anyone had told you in those years that the chemical diacetyl was toxic if inhaled, you would have taken steps to protect your employees, true? True.\nIf anyone at Flavor Development had ever told you that an ingredient in a flavor they were selling you was hazardous, you would never have let that flavor in your company door. Fair? Fair. Okay, I want to show you exhibit ten, Mr Peters, and this sort of moves the timeline ahead a little bit. This is another material data safety sheet from O'Laughlin Industries.\nIt was created or revised in April of 2010. Do you see that? Yes, sir. So this would have been about two years, I'm sorry, this would have been about five years before Nick Moncel left your employment, correct? Correct. And Olaflin now, the chemical company that is selling diacetyl to Flavor Development, they've now, you understand, updated their material data safety sheet with some new information. Okay.\nLet's look at what O'Loughlin was telling Flavor Development as early as April of 2010. On page two of this material data safety sheet served back in April of 2010. It states, I'm going to read this for the jury so you can see it as well, Mr. Peters. Chronic exposure may cause lung damage.\nRepeated exposure may cause damage to the red blood cells causing anemia and that word is butadiene and that's just another word for diacetyl. 2,3-butadiene has been linked to bronchiolitis obliterans, a disease characterized by inflammation and scarring in the smallest airways of the lungs which leads to severe and disabling shortness of breath. Do you see where I read that sir? Yes, I do.\nWhat a law firm is warning anyone who buys diacetyl from this document is that it can lead to bronchiolitis obliterans. Do you see that? Yes, sir.\nBefore this lawsuit was filed in 2017, flavor development never told Midwest Roasters that their flavors could cause bronchiolitis obliterans, did they? I believe they did not. And have you ever prior to this lawsuit heard of the disease bronchiolitis obliterans? No, sir. Okay. And again, had they told you that, you would have put a stop to using these flavors or protected your employees. Fair? Correct, yes. Let's look at page six of exhibit 10, Mr. Peters.\nThis is from the same 2010 material data safety sheet, and I want to focus on this page for this part here that says signs and symptoms of exposure. It says NIOSH, that's the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, has reported that employees exposed to butter flavorings containing diacetyl are at risk of developing occupational lung diseases that in one instant\nSimilar illnesses have been found among employees producing butter and vanilla flavorings containing diacetyl. For additional studies review OSHA literature on diacetyl and it links to a couple different places where you can read about the studies that the government has done. Do you see that? Yes, sir. Flavor developed never contacted you.\nor communicated to you in any way the warnings that flavor development received from O'Loughlin did they? Not to my knowledge, no. Did anyone at flavor development ever contact you and say hey you can look at this literature from NIOSH if you want about diacetyl to educate yourself further? No, sir. And flavor development never told you or your employees were at risk of developing what they call an occupational lung disease from diacetyl did they? No.\nAnd because you never heard of diacetyl until after this lawsuit was filed, your testimony is you",

And you never saw anything in writing at any time before 2017 from Flavor Development warning that diacetyl could be linked to bronchiolitis obliterans. Fair? Fair. And that's 2017 is long after Nick Moncel retired. True? Correct.\nAnd back on page four of, strike that, let me do this. I want to show you exhibit 22 in this case, Mr. Peters. And this is a form that the Laughlin Industries sent to flavor development. It's called an acknowledgement and receipt and review of MSDS, material data safety sheet. You see that? Yes, sir.\nAnd if we look at paragraph three here, what it says is we have received and read the MSDS for diacetyl in its entirety and fully understand its contents. Do you see that paragraph? Yes, sir. So what this is saying is that 2010 material data safety sheet we just saw, exhibit 10, whoever's signing this form says that we have received and read this MSDS for diacetyl. Do you see that? Yes, sir.\nAnd then on exhibit 21, paragraph eight, it says we confirm that if we resell this product or if we utilize it in a formulation, we will notify our customer, that'd be Midwest Roasters, true? True. We will notify our customer of the associated hazards by delivery of a suitable MSDS or other means in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations. Do you see that? Yes, sir.\nAnd on exhibit 21 at the bottom, do you see this document is signed by someone named Joseph Staffieri on August 31st, 2010? Correct. Do you know who Joseph Staffieri is, Mr. Peters? No, I do not. I'll represent to you that he's the president of flavor development, okay? Okay. And so what flavor development corporation is telling O'Loughlin is, yeah, we'll tell our customers, customers like you, everything in this material data safety sheet. Did you see that on that document? Yes.\nBut that did not happen because you never heard the word diacetyl until 2017, years after Mr. Munsell retired, correct? Correct. Flavor development never called you or warned you about the risk of bronchiolitis obliterans for your employees, did they? No. Not in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, or 2012, true? True. And they never provided written warnings to you and your employees.\nThat they were at risk for occupational lung disease during those years either did they? I did not see any. Now at some point flavor development did provide safety data sheets or information with the flavorings they sold you true? True. And I think the one that you do have is from 2017 true? I believe so. Okay, but\nAs far as warnings that specifically refer to diacetyl or the danger of bronchiolitis obliterans or the inhalation of that, you have no record or no knowledge of them ever providing that to you, true? I do not have knowledge of that. Because if they had, you would have taken all steps necessary to protect your employees, right? True.\nNow, Nick Monsell lives here in Hayward, where you live, correct? He does live in here, correct. And when's the last time you've seen Nick Monsell in person? I would say summertime, end of summer maybe. As far as keeping up with Nick's medical...\nhealth or his medical history you haven't gone to the doctor with him you haven't attended or talked to him about his health and how he's doing fair and No, I have not. so with regard to his health today or his health in the future or what he's going to face in the future you just don't have any knowledge one way or the other I do not. and while he was working at Midwest Roasters from 2008 until 2015 I assume Nick is not the kind of person who would sit down to you and talk to you about his doctor or his health or what's going on fair okay He did not, no. so as far as his health or his\nWhether or not he had shortness of breath or whether or not he was feeling good or bad on a given day, that's not something that you and Nick ever talked about, fair? No, we did not. I want you to know, Mr. Peters, that Nick Bonsell does not blame you or Midwest Roasters for what happened, okay? Okay. Objection to relevance. Nick Bonsell does not blame Midwest Roasters for what happened, and it's important that you understand that because Midwest Roasters did not.\nknow or have knowledge of the dangers of what was happening from flavor development.

Hi, Mr. Peters. Hi. My name is Brian Stufis. I represent Flavor Development Corp. You and I met a couple years ago at a walkthrough. Correct. Midwest Roasters, true? Correct.\nAnd I was present during your deposition about a year ago. We were on Zoom that day. Do you recall that? Yes, sir. Okay. Other than that, you and I haven't sat down and talked personally. Is that true? Correct. You haven't talked with anybody from my office as well. Is that correct? That's correct. And I want to take you back to that deposition that you gave about a year ago. Do you recall that? Yes, sir. Okay. Have you ever looked at the deposition transcript from that day?\nNo, sir. And since that time, have you met with Mr. Monsal's new attorney, Mr. Fadler here? Objection to the form of the question. Go ahead and answer. Yes, we did. Okay. And when was that? I don't remember, October, something like October, a couple months ago. So October of this year, roughly, Yes, sir. did Mr. Fadler come see you here in Hayward?\nMr. Fadler, who is That's me. oh I'm sorry, that was That's okay. Um yes. Okay. Um so at that time did he indicate you that he was Mr. Mancel's attorney, that he was coming up from Kansas City to visit with you? Yes, sir. Okay. And how long did you meet with him on that day? I'll say approximately an hour. Okay. And during that time, did he go over your deposition transcript uh with you that you gave last year? No. Okay.\nOkay. During that hour of time that you were meeting with Mr. Fadler, uh did he tell you about some of the questions that he'd be asking you here today? Um, I d I don't recall being told that um I I don't recall being told that, no. Um well during that hour that you were talking with Mr. Fadler, did he show you any documents? Uh I don't remember seeing any documents. Okay.\nDuring that hour that you met with Mr. Fabler, did he ask you similar questions to the ones that he just asked you here right now? Yes, sir. And I understood that flavor development, I'm sorry, I understand that Midwest Roasters from your last deposition testimony keeps a big binder of MSDS.\nsheets. Is Yes, that true? yes, sir. Because it wasn't just one MSDS that Flavor Development would send. As I understood yours and Ms. Peters' testimony, the MSDS would routinely come in the boxes with the flavors, true? I don't know if they did or not. I did not see every box.\nIt's possible that somebody else opened it or put it away, but I did not see every box. Right. So fair to say, and I understood this from your last deposition, that you didn't have a specific knowledge of what was in each MSDS that came from Midwest uh that came from Flavour Development. True? Objective form of the question. Uh\nimproper impeachment. Go ahead and answer, sir. Thank you. Would you repeat that? Sure, and I can actually ask it in a different way. You didn't actually see each MSDS that came from flavor development, true? I did not. And so if you got a MSDS for, say, butter rum versus an MSDS for another flavor such as vanilla, you wouldn't know which ones you were looking at or which ones you weren't. Is that true?\nWell, if I read it, I would. Right. But as you sit here today, you don't have a specific recall, say from 2008 to 2012, which specific flavors you looked at MSDS for. Is Correct, that right? I don't. Right. So for the time period 2008 to 2012, you don't know specifically what was contained in each flavor's MSDS. Is that true? True.\nDid you know that not all of the flavors that were sold to Midwest Roasters, that some of them didn't contain any diacetyl? That I don't know. Okay. And did Mr. Fadler tell you how much diacetyl was in any of the flavors that may have been sold to Midwest Roasters? No.\nI mean, you wouldn't expect a safety data sheet for a flavor that didn't contain diacetyl to have any warnings about a chemical that wasn't in it. Fair? Fair.",

And you never saw Mr. Mansell going through that book and looking at any safety data sheets, is that true? I do not recall seeing him look at it. I'm going to show you uh what we're going to mark as an exhibit. I guess we can work out the numbering of this.\nanother time should we just call exhibit one for now you know just because we're going to be rolling this at trial Brian if it's okay with you why don't you use a defendant's number I'm sure it'll be on our list too I just don't have the list in front of me and in an effort to keep things simple there Let's mark let's mark this as exhibit 501 is you go that Midwest roasters employee handbook mr. Peters\nIt appears to be. And is that something that Midwest Roasters provided to Mr. Mansell when he worked there? I I believe so, but I wouldn't I wouldn't have been the one to hand it to him. Would So that have been Ms. Peters or Yes, someone? most likely. And I'm going to mark this as Exhibit 502.\nNow the title of this document is Backroads Coffee and Tea, Beaux Chaux update, chemical update sign off. Do you recognize that document? No, sir. Okay. I'll ask Ms. Peters about that one. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Now, Mr. Fadler asked you some questions about Mr. Mansell. You worked right next to Mr. Mansell on many days while he was working there, correct? Yes, sir.\nSo this would have been from 2008 to 2015. Whenever he was there, you were typically there as well, True? correct? Correct. So I think you were there every day, right? Correct. All right. And you mixed flavors right alongside Mr. Mansell, true? In the same room, yes. All right. And you never observed Mr. Mansell having any breathing issues at work, correct? I did not.\nThat's a correct statement. Correct, yes. And you never observed Mr. Mansell being short of breath at work, correct? Correct. You never observed him coughing a lot, correct? Correct.\nI think that's all I have for now. Thank you. Thank you, Brian. Mr. Peters, when you and I met here in Hayward a couple months ago, I asked you the same questions I asked you today, correct? Pretty much, yes. And did I tell you all I wanted you to do was tell the truth about what happened? Correct. Did I suggest that you be dishonest in any way or did I tell you to be dishonest? No, sir. Okay. Mr. Stepp has asked you if you have any specific recollection of what was in whatever.\nmaterial data safety sheet that flavor development would have sent you. But as I recovered, I think pretty exhaustively when I was asking you questions, if it had contained anything regarding diacetyl or the dangers of diacetyl, you as an owner of Midwest Roasters would have taken action to protect people. Correct. I don't have any further questions. Off the record. That's it. Wait, I wasn't done. Oh, you're not done? I'm kidding, I'm done. Okay.\nNow when they say they're done, then what you have to do is run. But We're if you say off the record. uh We're off the record. Okay. We're going off the record at nine twenty.",
